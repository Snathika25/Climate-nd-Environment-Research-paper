**Climate and Environmental Data Analysis Using Machine Learning Models**

**->** This repository contains research and code for a climate change prediction system that uses machine learning algorithms—Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression—to classify climate-related events. 
**->** The models are trained on environmental data, including variables like temperature, precipitation, and greenhouse gas emissions, to predict abnormal climate trends and extreme weather events.

Key Highlights:

**Data Collection & Preprocessing:** 
                                  The study utilizes publicly available climate data from sources like NOAA and ECMWF, ensuring thorough preprocessing with methods such as feature scaling and dimensionality reduction.
**Modeling Approaches:** 
                      Each algorithm has unique advantages—SVM for high-dimensional data, KNN for pattern similarity, and Logistic Regression for binary classification.
**Evaluation Metrics:** 
                      Models are assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to address imbalanced data challenges typical of climate datasets.

**=>** The results indicate that KNN demonstrated higher accuracy in predicting climate anomalies, making it especially effective for short-term predictions. Future work includes ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy and adaptability to evolving climate patterns.
